    <h1>Web 4 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Web 4, the new generation of the web. Web 4 is going to enable users to use the internet much faster, more safely, and more intuitively. This documentation will provide a general overview of the architecture and features of Web 4, including how one gets started with development on the platform.</p>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>Web 4 depends on blockchain-based decentralized infrastructure; thus, it allows peer-to-peer transactions and the sharing of data in a secure form. The following are the layers of this platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Network Layer</b></li>
      <p>A decentralized network of nodes that allows users and applications to communicate and exchange data.</p>
      <li><b>Blockchain Layer</b></li>
      <p>A decentralized, secure ledger of all the various data exchanges in transactional form on the network.</p>
      <li><b>Application Layer</b></li>
      <p>A layer of dApps that then provide services and functionality to the end users.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Web 4 offers a range of new and upcoming features that helps new and current developers like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Confuscated Identify</b>: Developers have full control over what DSB (data scraping bots) can collect from their domain.(IP, location, name, etc.) While this is great for security, scammers cannot be identified by normal people. Which is why websites have a unique decryption key to access this information, we have designed DSBs that can bypass this which can be used by FBI, trusted developers and backdooring scams.</li>
      <li><b>Secure Transactions</b>: Fast and secure transactions enabled by blockchain technology. Transaction details cannot be considered 'sold data'. Your website can and will be shutdown. </li>
      <li><b>Enviorment</b>: Web 4 ensures that you have a secure and stable environment to develop on. Web 4 uses a python/java virtual machine to run your code. This means that you can develop with computer-based code and have it run within your website, this also makes it so that you cannot infect a persons computer just by entering a website.</li>
      <b>These features are not final, so some may be added later on.</b>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with developing on Web 4, follow these steps: </p>
    <h3>1. Install the Web 4 SDK</h3>
    <p>The Web 4 SDK provides a set of tools and libraries for building dApps on the platform.</p>
    <h3>2. Choose a Programming Language</h3>
    <p>Web 4 supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript</p>
    <h3>3. Build your dApp</h3>
    <p>Once you have chosen a programming language, you can start building your dApp.</p>
    <h3>4. Deploy Your dApp</h3>
    <p>Deploy your dApp on your desired website hoster.</p>
